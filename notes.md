To add a local server using NodeJs is easier than thought. 

All you have to keep in mind is:
have node installed and running the right version on terminal

type "npm nit -y" on terminal to do 
package json (just to remember it's important to make some alterations) - javascript object notation

type "npm install lite-server", wait for it to download all packages (node modules) 

then you can change the "test" to "start" : "lite-server" at package json

to run it, you just have to type "npm start" on terminal and that's it! The magic has happened, your local server is created and functioning as expected.
